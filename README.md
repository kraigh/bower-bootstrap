# Bootstrapping Bootstrap / Bower / Jade
## Installation:
* Note: If you're using Mac OSX, many of these installs will be easier with [Homebrew]().
1. You're going to need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
    * Installing with Homebrew: `brew install node`
2. Make sure you have [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed. `ruby -v` will tell you if you have it installed or not.
    * Installing with Homebrew: `brew install ruby`
3. In the project root, run `npm install`
    * This will install gulp and all its dependencies
4. In the project root, run `bower install`
    * This will install Bootstrap and Font Awesome
